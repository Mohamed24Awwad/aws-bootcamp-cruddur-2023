# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
--------------
### Docker.
It was really cool once I managed to build docker images to the front && back end, till reaching to open the Cruddur app, it was really amazing to be able to do that, either it's my first time going through with GitHub codespaces as well the AWS Cloud9 service which's a pleasant experience to me.


### Containerization Security 
Regarding the container security part, I begin using AWS Inspector to deal with and fix the vulns in my boot camp repo which's really helpful to figure out the security issues located in the docker files and the different NodeJS versions at the frontend docker image in addition how to make pull requests to switch to the latest version of it to get rid of the vulns which detected, so overall it's a marvelous experience to me as it's my first time to hands-on such a practical methodology regarding the cloud security part.

### Nontifications
Accomplished the notifications component with successful status in both Front and Back End,either getting a pretty much of the OpenAPI platform and managed to document the Flask API through a well Readme file Finally get the app up and running as the screenshot below explains.
